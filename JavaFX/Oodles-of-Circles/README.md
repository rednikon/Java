Write a JavaFX Application OoodlesOfCircles that draws 100 circles of random fill color, random stroke color,
random stroke thickness (up to 20 pixels) and random size (up to a radius of 150 pixels), in random locations.
Make sure that each circle appears in the visible area of the scene.  That is, if the circle is not entirely visible,
don't show it at all.
