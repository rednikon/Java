Class Exercise #24: Write a method with signature double power(int n, int exponent) that computes n to the exponent power, i.e., exponent, i.e. n multiplied by itself exponent times.
 For example, power(2, 3) is 8.  Implement the method using recursion.
 In a main method, test power(3, 4).  It should yield 81.
 
 Recursive Squares: Build a JavaFX program using recursion to create a scene of squares with alternating colors.
 
 Recursive Tree: Take the example shown in class, RecursiveTree, and play with it.  See if you can make it more random.
