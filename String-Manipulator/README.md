Write a program with two classes:

1. A StringDemo class with the main method that calls the methods of your StringManipulator class. 

2. A StringManipulator class with two methods:
The first method calls String methods on an array of type String with at least three (3) different String methods calls INSIDE a for-each loop (see Lecture 3: Program Control Statements#foreachloop)
The second method calls at least three (3) different String methods on individual Strings that are not in a String array.
 
Note that println() is NOT a method of the String class, and so it also does not count toward the minimum of at least three (3) String methods.

Optional Challenge:
Write two STATIC methods for your StringManipulator class, one for its for-each loop, and the other for its Strings that are not in a for-each loop. Make sure that the StringDemo class calls static methods of the StringManipulator class by using the class name rather than an object name.
