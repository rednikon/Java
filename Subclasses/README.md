Write a program in which you create a class, a subclass of that class, and a demo class with main.
The subclass must: override a method inherited from its immediate superclass and use the keywords this and super to make use of both versions of the overridden method.
The class with main should not be a subclass of any class. The main method must show the results of the method calls.

Bonus: Use this. and super. to reference fields or super() or super(args) to call a constructor.
Bonus: Use an abstract class.
